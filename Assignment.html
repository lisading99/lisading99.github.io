			In this assignment, you will develop a new course website for the course CSC B20 using HTML and CSS. You are notallowed to use any web framework such as BootStrap and JQuery etc.  You must work in groups of two.  We did makesome exceptions for Assignment1, and however, for this assignment, we ask you to form teams of 2.  The webpagemust be usable,  responsive,  and visually appealing.  Below is an example course page,  however it is up to you tocreate a design following the mandates listed in this assignment.  I want you to have some fun with this assignment.There are some minimum requirements, but for the most part, there is a lot of creativity!
